# Tomorrow@Brown
This is a project created by Morgan Lo, Nick Klatsky, Chris Chen and Adam Lalani for Hack@Brown. Tomorrow at Brown is a search engine for all things Brown University. Through search at Brown, users are able to make free text queries to find exactly what they are looking for. For example, users could search "show me events at Brown related to computer science recruiting?" Data for this project is extracted using the Gmail API. The backend for this project is built with Python. Pandas is used for data handling and storage, NLTK is used for data processing, and TF-IDF is used for document scoring. The front-end is developed with Tailwind, React & CSS.
